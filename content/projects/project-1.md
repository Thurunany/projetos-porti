Welcome to my personal portfolio website!

This site was created using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, a fast and flexible static site generator. Instead of using a pre-made theme, I built the layout from the ground up using **W3.CSS** â€” a lightweight and responsive CSS framework.

#### ðŸ”§ Key Features

- Custom Hugo layouts (no themes)
- Responsive grid-style project gallery
- Sidebar navigation with smooth section links
- Simple and elegant design with minimal dependencies
- Easy to maintain and deploy

The goal of this project was to create a clean and professional space to showcase my work, while learning more about Hugo's templating system and static site architecture.

This portfolio is hosted using **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** â€” a free and simple way to serve static sites directly from a GitHub repository.
